                            Abstract: This paper examines how the expansion of large, multi-establishment (national)
                            employers influences the wage and hiring policies of smaller, local firms. Although these
                            expansions are firms' independent decisions, understanding their spillover effects is
                            important for evaluating policies that aim to attract new large employers. Using
                            administrative data from Brazil that cover firms' wages and employment across different
                            locations and occupations, I conduct a matched event study to assess how local employers
                            respond to significant, idiosyncratic labor demand shifts by national employers. The
                            findings reveal that when national employers increase wages in large cities by 8 log points
                            (relative to other employers in large cities), they simultaneously raise wages by 5 log
                            points and expand employment in other locations. This expansion pressures local employers to
                            increase wages by 2 log points, resulting in a 1.5 log point wage growth for incumbent
                            workers. Despite local employers reducing employment, workers are not adversely affected
                            because they reallocate to the expanding national employers.</div>

                            Abstract: In the long run, we are all dead. Nonetheless, when studying the short-run
                            dynamics of economic models, it is crucial to consider boundary conditions that govern
                            long-run,
                            forward-looking behavior, such as transversality conditions. We demonstrate that machine
                            learning (ML) can automatically satisfy these conditions due to its inherent inductive
                            bias toward finding flat solutions to functional equations. This characteristic enables ML
                            algorithms to solve for transition dynamics, ensuring that long-run boundary conditions
                            are approximately met. ML can even select the correct equilibria in cases of steady-state
                            multiplicity.
                            Additionally, the inductive bias provides a foundation for modeling forward-looking
                            behavioral agents with self-consistent expectations.

                            Abstract: We develop a unified theoretical framework to quantify how firms in local labor
                            markets respond to industry-level productivity shocks. By extending the standard monopsony
                            model of Card et al. (2018) to a general equilibrium setting, we incorporate cross-employer
                            spillovers that allow firms to respond endogenously to changes in workers' outside options,
                            which arise from productivity shifts in other local industries. Using German administrative
                            data, we estimate the model using national industry wage premiums and their
                            employment-weighted local averages as proxies for industry-specific and aggregate local
                            productivity shocks. Our analysis reveals strong outside option effects and limited
                            variation in local monopsony power. Our parameter estimates indicate that a 1% increase in
                            an industry's productivity raises wages in that industry by approximately 0.47%, while a 1%
                            increase in average local labor market productivity raises all local wages by about 0.53%.
                            Additionally, a 1% increase in productivity above the local labor market average increases
                            employment share by 1.04%. A simulation of a 10% subsidy to the machinery sector
                            demonstrates substantial wage spillovers varying from 0.01% to 1.2% and significant labor
                            reallocation.
