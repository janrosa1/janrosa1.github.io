                <p>I am a labor economist, interested in understanding firms' labor demand determination and wage-setting behavior. In my research, I integrate applied microeconometric techniques with analyses of general equilibrium effects.</p>

                <p>In my job market paper <b>National Firms, Local Effects: Spillovers from Multi-Establishment Employers' Expansions</b>, I examine how expansions of large, multi-establishment (national) employers—periods marked by intense hiring activity and wage increases—impact the wage and hiring policies of other (local) employers. My findings are important for accurately evaluating place-based policies aimed at attracting large employers to local labor markets.</p>

                            Abstract: This paper examines how the expansion of large, multi-establishment (national) employers influences the wage and hiring policies of smaller, local firms. Although these expansions are firms' independent decisions, understanding their spillover effects is important for evaluating policies that aim to attract new large employers. Using administrative data from Brazil that cover firms' wages and employment across different locations and occupations, I conduct a matched event study to assess how local employers respond to significant, idiosyncratic labor demand shifts by national employers. The findings reveal that when national employers increase wages in large cities by 8 log points (relative to other employers in large cities), they simultaneously raise wages by 5 log points and expand employment in other locations. This expansion pressures local employers to increase wages by 2 log points, resulting in a 1.5 log point wage growth for incumbent workers. Despite local employers reducing employment, workers are not adversely affected because they reallocate to the expanding national employers.

                            Abstract: In the long run, we are all dead. Nonetheless, when studying the short-run dynamics of economic models, it is crucial to consider boundary conditions that govern long-run, 
                            forward-looking behavior, such as transversality conditions. We demonstrate that machine learning (ML) can automatically satisfy these conditions due to its inherent inductive 
                            bias toward finding flat solutions to functional equations. This characteristic enables ML algorithms to solve for transition dynamics, ensuring that long-run boundary conditions 
                            are approximately met. ML can even select the correct equilibria in cases of steady-state multiplicity. 
                            Additionally, the inductive bias provides a foundation for modeling forward-looking behavioral agents with self-consistent expectations.
