                        Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of multi-location (national) employers on the policies of smaller (local) firms. 
                        Using Brazilian employer-employee data, I explore the spillover effects both on the job and worker levels. To distinguish spillover effects from local productivity changes, 
                        I develop a portable empirical strategy that relies on the national employers' activities in large cities, likely unaffected by labor market dynamics in small or 
                        medium-sized locations. Furthermore, by disaggregating the wage and employment changes of national firms, this strategy enables the identification of wage and 
                        employment changes specific to each national employer. Subsequently, I construct a shift-share measure of the labor market exposure to the national employers' labor demand shocks.
                        Employing an event study design, I examine the long-term effects of substantial positive change in the shift-share measure. 
                        The findings reveal positive and slow-increasing wage effects on local employers and negative employment spillovers. 
                        Moreover, I show that both new hirers and incumbent local employers' workers experience the wage increases.

                        Abstract: In the long run, we are all dead. Nonetheless, when studying the short-run dynamics of economic models, it is crucial to consider boundary conditions that govern long-run, 
                        forward-looking behavior, such as transversality conditions. We demonstrate that machine learning (ML) can automatically satisfy these conditions due to its inherent inductive 
                        bias toward finding flat solutions to functional equations. This characteristic enables ML algorithms to solve for transition dynamics, ensuring that long-run boundary conditions 
                        are approximately met. ML can even select the correct equilibria in cases of steady-state multiplicity. 
                        Additionally, the inductive bias provides a foundation for modeling forward-looking behavioral agents with self-consistent expectations.
