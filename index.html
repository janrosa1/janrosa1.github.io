            <p>I am labor economist, interested in understanding firms' labor demand determination and wage-setting behavior. In my research, I integrate applied microeconometric techniques with analyses of general equilibrium effects.</p>

            <p>In my job market paper <b> National Firms, Local Effects: Spillovers from Multi-Establishment Employers' Expansions</b>, I examine how expansions of large, multi-establishment (national) employers—periods marked by intense hiring activity and wage increases—impact the wage and hiring policies of other (local) employers. My findings are important for accurately evaluating place-based policies aimed at attracting large employers to local labor markets. </p> 
            <p>My expected graduation date is July 2025. I will be available for interviews in the 2024-2025 job market. You can find my CV <a href="CV/CV_JR.pdf">here</a></p>

                        Abstract: This paper investigates how expansions of large multi-establishment (national) employers—characterized by intense hiring activity and wage increases—affect the wage and hiring policies of smaller (local) employers. To distinguish spillover effects from local productivity changes, I develop an empirical strategy that leverages the activities of national employers in large cities, which are likely unaffected by labor market dynamics in less populous areas. This approach allows me to construct shift-share instruments that identify local labor market exposure to idiosyncratic labor demand shocks of national employers. Implementing this strategy using Brazilian administrative data and combining matching with an event study design, I examine the long-term effects of significant positive change in the shift-share measure. I find that a rapid 10% increase in the shift-share wage measure corresponds with national employers increasing wages by 5.5% and employment by 30% in labor markets outside the large cities. This expansion pressures local employers to raise wages by 3%, resulting in a 1.5% wage growth at the worker level. Although local employers reduce employment by about 2%, this does not adversely affect workers' employment prospects, as they reallocate to the expanding employers. I argue that labor market wage spillovers are an important factor in evaluating place-based policies.

                        Abstract: In the long run, we are all dead. Nonetheless, when studying the short-run dynamics of economic models, it is crucial to consider boundary conditions that govern long-run, 
                        forward-looking behavior, such as transversality conditions. We demonstrate that machine learning (ML) can automatically satisfy these conditions due to its inherent inductive 
                        bias toward finding flat solutions to functional equations. This characteristic enables ML algorithms to solve for transition dynamics, ensuring that long-run boundary conditions 
                        are approximately met. ML can even select the correct equilibria in cases of steady-state multiplicity. 
                        Additionally, the inductive bias provides a foundation for modeling forward-looking behavioral agents with self-consistent expectations.
